				<h1>Who is Daisuke Sato?</h1>
				<div id="intro">
				<p>
					<span>Welcome</span> to my page! My name is Daisuke Sato. If you
					are looking for a Japanese worker who is a little different from others, you are in right place.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I</span> have excellent comprehension and retention to adapt to new skills quickly. In my college years, I have obtained knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), laws in the U.S., economical analysis, programming languages (JAVA and web-based programming skills), business-level English and more. I believe I have successfully improved my skills as a business person since I came to the United States 4 years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As</span> I have brought up my own skills to a higher level in a short period of time, I have been always productive in self-development in order to achieve an ideal goal. My ability of problem-solving by improving my capacity must be profitable for a firm, and I will be ready for expanding my capability to any new fields I will encounter in the firm.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If</span> you are interested in hiring me, please continue 
					exploring who I am.
